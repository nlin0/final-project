  Our project is an RPG text-based escape game within the terminal. The player
  will be taken through a text adventure, encountering events and being offered
  decisions.

  Such decisions will affect the course of the story, with events including:
  encountering enemies (that drop loot) in turn based combat system; 
  encountering chests (which need a key to open); and ecnountering random events 
  with somewhat randomized narrative text.
