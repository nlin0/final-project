Sorry!\n\n>> Using any food item will grant you a generous amount of hp (or not.. depends on how lucky you are with your meat). However, you miss an attack turn.\n>> Selecting empty slots, or any non-weapons will either cause you to attack with your fist, or trigger a special event with said item.\n>> Selecting your health bar will just display your health bar. Nothing else happens.\n>> Using any weapon boosts your damage (amount depends on the weapon).\n\n That’s basically it. Good luck!",
