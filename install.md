# Ready to Try to Escape in One Piece????

Before we can try to escape, there is just a couple of logistical differences that we need to get set up with first.

There is a couple of packages we would need you to install first before we can jump right in...

Inside the parent directory of everything (it should look something like **\_** terminal-esc%), we should first type in the followings:

- opam install yojson

## BEFORE YOU START YOUR ESCAPE

Please read the REDAME.md file. There is an error with our file paths! But we were told that if we included this in our README we will be okay.

## Ok... now that you have read the README.md

To start your escapade, type in the following into the terminal:
"dune exec ./bin/main.exe".

That's all..... Goodluck man... We hope to see you on the other side......
